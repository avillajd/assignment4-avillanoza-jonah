### **Jonah Avillanoza** 
I, *Jonah Avillanoza*, have read the point deduction list and understand that I will lose points for missing items.
### Questions I Have for you Efren: 
On my website i would like to learn how to make the `<div class="workdescription">`  to scroll and keep up with the images if the body copy is not as long as the images i have included. I would like it to have the look in which the user can scroll the images and see the numerous images included in the **Work** section and still be able to read the project description hopefully that makes sense.... 

Currently the section is coded in CSS as such:

``` css
.workdescription {
    float: right;
    padding-top: 194px;
    padding-right: 45px;
    font-family: helvetica;
    color: #707070;
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.subh3 {
    padding-top: 25px;
}

.locationforproject {
    font-weight: 400;
}

.storyforwork {
    padding-top: 50px;
}
```

Here is an **image** as per the assignment:
